## Unit 6 | Assignment - What's the Weather Like?

As part of the weather_plot assignment, this WeatherPy.ipynb file will visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, the file utilizes a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Following 4 scatter plots were made to showcase the following relationship:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

From the plot, following observations can be made:
1) The maximum tempreture is corrolated to the lattitude of the city. As the city lattitude is close to 0 (equator ) the maximum temperature increases, and the more farther away
